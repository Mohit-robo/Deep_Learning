<summary>Pytorch_series</summary>

This sub directory contains specifically `Pytorch` related content, i.e, `creating CNN`, `creating RNN`, `tensorboard`, `Dataloader`, `transfer learning`, `data augmentation`, etc.

Some other files included, share knowledge about advance `Pytorch` [concepts](Pytorch_series\Advance/README.md).

`Advance`: Contains advance Pytorch topics such as dealing with gradents during back prop, autograd, the `README.md` file the training loop for Pytorch. 
`Errors`: Mentions some common `Pytorch` related erros.

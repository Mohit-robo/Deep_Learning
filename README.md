# Deep Learning Practice
### The main directory contains main files of the series of codes written for various Deep Learning terminologies.
The sub directories contain experimented codes for various activation functions -- sigmoid, tanh, weight initialization techniques -- He, Kaiming, etc and testing such other terminologies. 

### The basic code contains:

    2 Layers
    ReLU Activation function
    kaiming weight initialization
    

Throughout the Series we can experiment with various Weight Initialzation Techniques, Loss functions, Activation functions, Regulatization Techniques, Data Augmentation, Adding hidden layers,etc


The primary library around which all the codes will be written is **Numpy** and **Matplolib**

Some results with the current basic code when ran for 10000 iteration are:

    LR = 0.01 ,lambda = 1e-5
    After 0 iteration the cost computed is 1.1166361957022528 
    After 2500 iteration the cost computed is 0.77275839427853 
    After 5000 iteration the cost computed is 0.6569099735510869 
    After 7500 iteration the cost computed is 0.5868220064638342 
    After 10000 iteration the cost computed is 0.516242616924809
